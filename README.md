## TYPES OF TUMORS
### Benign Tumor
- Non- cancerous
- Capsulated
- Non-invassive
- Slow growing
### Malignant Tumor
- Cancerous
- Non-capsulated
- Fast growing
#### The data is derived from Fine needle aspiration.
Parameters:
- radius_mean
- texture_mean
- perimeter_mean
- area_mean
- smoothness_mean
- compactness_mean
- concavity-mean
- concavepoints_mean
- symmetry_mean
- fractal_dimension_mean

#### Built a simple Neural Network with Tensorflow and Keras
